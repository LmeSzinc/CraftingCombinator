Version: 0.1.4
Date: 2022-11-04
  Info:
    - First release of Xeraph's fork (based on Crafting Combinator 0.16.3)
    - Migration to this version will acknowledge the removal of 'crafting_combinator:settings-entity (programmable-speaker)' and its related objects, this is expected
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed possible duping if an incorrect recipe is sent to cc (https://github.com/theRustyKnife/CraftingCombinator/issues/70)
    - Fixed GUI not closing when its associated cc/rc is destroyed
    - Fixed cc's tendency to insert too much items from the overflow chest after recipe switch (https://mods.factorio.com/mod/crafting_combinator/discussion/632ce909888658ef30d15be0 https://forums.factorio.com/viewtopic.php?p=570197#p570197)
      - By default, cc will insert ingredients for only two craft cycles, this can be changed individually for each cc
  Features:
    - Blueprints and ghosts now carry cc and rc data
    - New sticky behaviour: Craft-n-before-switch
      - This behaviour addresses the changing or flip-flopping of recipes due to the fluctuation of signals caused by crafting machine's buffer (be it in the input slot or the "limbo" while the machine is crafting) (https://github.com/theRustyKnife/CraftingCombinator/issues/64)
      - This is how it currently works:
        - If a cc needs to change or clear a recipe with the setting enabled (more than 0), it will enter sticky mode for that amount of craft cycles and not respond to any signal change
        - Once sticky period is over, the cc will evaluate the signals for one update cycle and change recipe if necessary, after which the cc will be allowed to engage sticky mode again
        - The duration of sticky period is evaluated only once per sticky mode activation. It is calculated based on machine's crafting progress and speed. Actual product is not taken into account in bringing the cc out of sticky mode - this is the intended design for UPS reason
      - By default a new/migrated cc is set to allow one more craft cycle before recipe switch
    - Cloning of cc and rc is now handled (e.g. Space Exploration's spaceship)
    - Mod settings added for the following features:
      - Module chest inventory size (in Startup)
      - Craft-n-before-switch for newly placed cc
      - Input buffer size (during recipe change) for newly placed cc
  Locale:
    - Fixed duplicate key for cs.cfg
    - Missing translations for new keys
  Changes:
    - Optimized cc idle performance (https://github.com/theRustyKnife/CraftingCombinator/pull/71).
      - As a result from this optimization, the combinator will no longer attempt to switch recipe if the chosen recipe/state of no recipe is the same as the previous update cycle
      - The optimization above might cause unintended cc behaviours
      - As a general rule, cc in this version does not respond well to manual interventions - hence the behaviour of cc does not clear recipe for manually set assemblers
      - Sending a signal or resetting the cc setup should fix this
    - Event registration now uses filters
    - Improved event handling for module chest, uses mine-entity instead of manual inventory management
    - Depreciated the usage of programmable speaker to store bp settings (settings-parser module)
